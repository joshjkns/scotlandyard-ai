## Features

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Utilises Monte Carlo Tree Search, in MTCS.java to find the best moves for MrX to take.
- **Multi Threading**: Uses multi threading to speed up computation.
- **Min-Max trees**: A form of decision tree that is used in most of the AI's to pick the optimal move.
- **UltraFast**: An approximation of Min-Max Trees, that allow for greater look ahead and therefore better AI moves.
